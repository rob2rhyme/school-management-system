# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open public GitHub issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

Preferred reporting methods:
- GitHub Security Advisories (if enabled): use “Report a vulnerability”.
- Otherwise: open a GitHub issue with the title prefix **`[SECURITY]`** and include **minimal details** (enough to contact you), then we will follow up privately.

## What to Include

- Affected area (route/module/file)
- Impact and severity assessment (if known)
- Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept (private if possible)
- Suggested mitigation (optional)

## Disclosure Guidance

- Do not publicly disclose exploit details until a fix is released.
- Avoid posting secrets, tokens, or real user data in any report.

## Response Timeline

We aim to respond on a **best-effort** basis:
- Acknowledgement: within **7 days**
- Status update: within **14 days**

Complex issues may take longer depending on severity and maintainer availability.
