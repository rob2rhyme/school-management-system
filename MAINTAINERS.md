# Maintainers Policy

This project welcomes open-source contributions. Maintainers help keep the project healthy and review contributions, but **maintainership does not imply ownership** of the project or its IP.

## What a Maintainer Is

A maintainer is a contributor who is granted additional responsibilities, such as:
- Triaging issues and keeping labels/milestones organized
- Reviewing pull requests and requesting changes
- Merging approved pull requests
- Helping enforce security, quality, and documentation standards

## How Maintainers Are Selected

Maintainers are selected by the project owner based on:
- Consistent, high-quality contributions over time
- Good communication and collaboration
- Demonstrated security-mindedness (tenant isolation, least privilege, safe defaults)
- Familiarity with the roadmap and architecture direction

Selection is discretionary and may change as the project evolves.

## Compensation and Expectations

- Maintainers may be **unpaid volunteers**.
- If paid maintainer or contractor roles are created in the future, they will be offered **separately and explicitly** (outside of open-source contributions).
- Maintainership does **not** create an expectation of payment, equity, or royalties.

## Ownership

- The project owner retains ownership and final decision-making authority.
- Contributions are licensed under the project’s open-source license (see `LICENSE`).
